# Crud project using Material UI.

This time, guided by the professor of an online course, I learned and put into practice several coding techniques, and got to know several facilitating libs that allowed the completion of this project. It is an application for listing people and cities, something apparently simple, but which taught me a lot over the course of 3 months.<br>

## How to run application:

### To install all project dependences:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

### To view the application in the browser via localhost:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

### To run the backend simulated by the json server(in other terminal):
```bash
npm run server
```
or
```bash
yarn server
```
